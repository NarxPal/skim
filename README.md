# Deployment URLs
| Environment | Frontend URL            | Backend URL             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Dev (Local) | `http://localhost:3000` | `http://localhost:3001` |

<br />

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTICE**
>
> BY DEFAULT, THIS PROJECT IS MEANT TO RUN **LOCALLY** FOR A SMOOTH AND RICH EXPERIENCE.
>
> IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT LAG, COLD STARTS, OR PERFORMANCE ISSUES,  
> YOU CAN RUN IT IN PRODUCTION USING THE [PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE](#-production-deployment-guide).

> I would highly recommend using skim locally using the url provided for dev. Things aren't going to work perfect and smooth in production environment :(

# üßë‚Äçüíª Local Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NarxPal/skim.git
cd skim
```

### Install Dependencies 

```bash
cd ./frontend
npm install
```

```bash
cd ../backend #if u are in frontend directory do this
#or
cd ./backend #if u are in skim directory do this
npm install
```

### Create environment files

Create a `.env` file in the root of both **frontend** and **backend** folders.

#### üîß Frontend (`frontend/.env`)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

#### üîß Backend

> ‚ö†Ô∏è In `backend` directory i have already included `.env.example` file which contains temporary demo credentials. Please use responsibly.

<br />

> Run the following command and it will automatically copy the code of `.env.example` file and will create `.env` file.
```env
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run Locally

#### Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Backend
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

# üöÄ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: Free-tier hosting (Render) will introduce cold starts and lag, believe me :(

### üîß BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (NestJS)

change origin in `main.ts` file:
```bash
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.enableCors({
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000', // frontend port
    credentials: true,
  });
  await app.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 3001);
}
```

currently u will see `http://localhost:3000` change this to `https://skim-alpha.vercel.app`

also u have to uncomment psql db hosted environment variables in `.env` file and comment out environment variables running locally.

change backend port in `frontend` directory
<br />
change this:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

to this:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://skim-66sk.onrender.com
```
